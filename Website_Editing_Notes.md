# GenAI in Additive Manufacturing - Website 

# Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines a comprehensive plan to transform the repository into a modern, responsive educational website optimized for GitHub Pages hosting. The website will serve as an educational resource designed to introduce and guide users into generative AI applications within the additive manufacturing/3D printing industry.

## 1. Site Structure Analysis & Reorganization

### Current Structure
The existing site consists of separate HTML files with basic navigation between them:
- `index.html` (homepage)
- Content pages: `foundation_models.html`, `genai_agents.html`, `dataset.html`, etc.
- Individual project pages: `general_project1.html`, `agent2.html`, etc.

### Proposed Structure
We'll reorganize the content into five main sections as requested, maintaining the existing content but improving its organization:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Homepage] --> B[Intro to GenAI in Manufacturing]
    A --> C[Core Technologies & Frameworks]
    A --> D[Implementation Tutorials]
    A --> E[Case Studies & Applications]
    A --> F[Resources & Community]
    
    B --> B1[What is GenAI?]
    B --> B2[Benefits in AM]
    B --> B3[Current Landscape]
    
    C --> C1[Foundation Models]
    C --> C2[Generative AI Models]
    C --> C3[Fine-Tuning Approaches]
    
    D --> D1[Prompt Engineering]
    D --> D2[Model Selection]
    D --> D3[Deployment Strategies]
    
    E --> E1[GenAI Agents in AM]
    E --> E2[Process Optimization]
    E --> E3[Design Generation]
    
    F --> F1[Datasets Repository]
    F --> F2[Training Resources]
    F --> F3[Research Papers]
```

## 2. Technical Architecture

### Frontend Framework & Tools

```

## 7. Content Migration Strategy

### Complete Content Inventory
First, we'll create a comprehensive inventory of all existing content:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Content Inventory] --> B[HTML Pages]
    A --> C[Images]
    A --> D[CSS Styles]
    A --> E[Embedded Content]
    
    B --> B1[Main Pages<br>index.html, foundation_models.html, etc.]
    B --> B2[Project Pages<br>general_project1.html, agent2.html, etc.]
    
    C --> C1[Header Images]
    C --> C2[Project Icons]
    C --> C3[Diagrams & Screenshots]
    
    E --> E1[Code Blocks]
    E --> E2[Embedded Examples]
```

### Detailed Content Mapping
We'll create an explicit mapping from old to new structure:

| Current Page/Section | New Location | Migration Notes |
|----------------------|--------------|----------------|
| index.html (main content) | sections/intro/index.html | Preserve welcome message and overview |
| foundation_models.html | sections/core-technologies/foundation-models.html | Maintain all subsections intact |
| genai_agents.html | sections/case-studies/genai-agents.html | Preserve all agent examples |
| dataset.html | sections/resources/datasets.html | Keep dataset organization |
| general_project1.html | sections/tutorials/benchmarking-metrics.html | Preserve tutorial content |
| general_project2.html | sections/tutorials/benchmarking-tools.html | Maintain all tool descriptions |
| prompt_enginerring.html | sections/tutorials/prompt-engineering.html | Keep all prompt examples |
| agent_foundation.html | sections/case-studies/agent-foundation.html | Maintain case study content |

### Phased Migration Process

#### Phase 1: Content Extraction & Cleaning
1. **Systematic Extraction**: Extract content from each current HTML file, preserving:
   - Headings and subheadings (H1-H6)
   - Paragraph text
   - Lists and tables
   - Code examples
   - Image references and captions
   - Links (internal and external)

2. **Content Normalization**: 
   - Standardize heading levels
   - Ensure consistent formatting
   - Verify image references
   - Check link integrity

#### Phase 2: Template Creation & Content Population

1. **Template Development**:
   - Create section templates with progressive disclosure architecture
   - Develop components for different content types (text, code, images)
   - Implement responsive layouts that adapt to content types

2. **Content Population**:
   - Migrate content block-by-block to maintain integrity
   - Preserve exact wording and technical accuracy
   - Maintain all examples, code snippets, and technical details
   - Reorganize only at section/container level, not individual content

#### Phase 3: Link Restructuring & Redirection

1. **Internal Link Updates**:
   - Update all internal links to reflect new URL structure
   - Create a mapping of oldâ†’new URLs

2. **Redirection Strategy**:
   - Implement client-side redirects from old URLs to new structure
   - Add appropriate meta tags for SEO continuity

### Content Continuity Safeguards

#### Content Verification Process
To ensure no content is lost:

1. **Page-by-Page Verification**:
   - Create a checklist of all content blocks from original site
   - Check off each item as it's migrated to new structure
   - Verify completeness with automated tools

2. **Technical Content Integrity**:
   - Special attention to code blocks to maintain indentation and syntax
   - Verify all technical diagrams are preserved with proper resolution
   - Ensure all dataset descriptions remain accurate

3. **Cross-referencing System**:
   - Implement a dual-verification approach
   - Compare original pages with new pages programmatically
   - Highlight any missing sections automatically

#### Example: Foundation Models Migration

To illustrate with a concrete example, here's how `foundation_models.html` will be migrated:

1. **Extraction**:
   - Extract main heading "Developing GenAI Model for AM"
   - Extract introduction paragraph
   - Extract all 5 sections (Identifying AM Task, Selecting Base Model, etc.)
   - Preserve all links to project pages

2. **Restructuring into Progressive Disclosure**:
   - Top Section: Introduction and visual overview of foundation models
   - Middle Section: The 5-step process currently displayed
   - Bottom Section: Technical details from linked pages (consolidated)

3. **Content Enhancement**:
   - Add section navigation
   - Implement content depth indicators
   - Preserve all original examples and references

### Testing & Validation

#### Comprehensive Testing Plan
To validate successful migration:

1. **Content Completeness Testing**:
   - Automated comparison of text content before/after
   - Manual review of each major section
   - Verify image count and placement

2. **Technical Functionality Verification**:
   - Test all internal links
   - Verify code block formatting
   - Check responsive layout for all content types

3. **User Path Testing**:
   - Verify existing user journeys remain intact
   - Ensure new navigation doesn't disrupt access to existing content

### Documentation & Version Control

1. **Migration Documentation**:
   - Document all content moves in a migration log
   - Note any content adjustments or enhancements
   - Record any content that required special handling

2. **Version Control Strategy**:
   - Maintain separate branches for old and new structures
   - Create detailed commit history documenting each content migration
   - Enable rollback capability if issues are discovered
