        <h1>AM dataset for GenAI</h1>
        <p>This project develops a fine tuned customised model for melt pool defect detection.</p>
        
        <h2>Project Details</h2>
        <p> These datasets include process monitoring data, sensor readings, defect detection datasets, and material properties, which are essential for developing robust and accurate AI models. By leveraging these datasets, researchers can enhance model performance, improve predictive capabilities, and drive innovations in AM.
